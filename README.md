# Rails Programming

## PROJECT: RE-FORMER

## Introduction

In this project we created a simple form system following the instructions from [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/forms).
We used basic concepts of Ruby on Rails including:

- Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC)
- Data Structures & Relationships
- Routing
- Migrations
- Views with forms, partials, and helpers
- RESTful design
- Adding gems for extra features

This is a simple app where you can create users, and edit their details.

The main page will display all the created users.

To create a new user press the 'New User' button in the page. There you can add a username, email and password.

You can edit the user just clicking on its username on the main page.
